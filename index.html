      <p>My name is Brian Arth and I am, more or less, a returning student.  I spent my work career in banking for 12 yrs before taking on the mantle of "Mr. Mom".  Not sure which of those was more difficult, but I can tell you which one smelled the worst.  My children are all in school so my workload has dramatically dropped.  This among other things, made me realize it was time to return to the work force.</p>

      <p>As exciting as banking sounds, it wasn't.  I was in every area at some point or another; collections, customer service, risk, fraud, lending, etc.  Though they were interesting at times, it wasn't anything to build a career on.  So now that I have the time and resources, I decided that it was time to look into what I wanted to do and avoid the duldroms of "just any job".</p>

      <p>Through much deliberation, I arrived at computers.  I am fairly competent using a computer, but I had no real idea how they do what they do.  I did a lot of reading and realized that coding was the answer.  So here I am.  Wish me luck!</p>
